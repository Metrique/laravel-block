# laravel-building

A flexible page management system for Laravel 5.

## Installation

Add the following to the `repositories` section of your composer.json

```
"repositories": [
    {
        "url": "https://github.com/Metrique/laravel-building",
        "type": "git"
    }
],
```

1. Add `"Metrique/laravel-building": "dev-master"` to the require section of your composer.json.
2. Add `Metrique\Building\BuildingServiceProvider::class` to your list of service providers in `config/app.php`.
3. `composer update`.
4. `php artisan migrate`.
5. `php artisan metrique:building-seed`.

### Config
You can publish the `config/building.php` config file to your application config directory by running `php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-building"`

### Views
You can create your own views instead of using the laravel-building defaults by overriding the `$views` property in any controller or by publishing the view files to your own application with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-building"`

### Migrations
laravel-building migrations will be automatically run when the `php artisan migrate` command is executed.

### Routes
laravel-building ships with a default set of resource controllers of which you can easily adjust the url 'prefix' for via the config file.

If you prefer more fine grained control then you may extend the `BuildingServiceProvider.php` file into your own application, and override the `bootRoutes` method.

- To do.
